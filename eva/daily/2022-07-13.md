## Originally Planned

### CDP Scrapers Undergrads Management
Finish responding and leaving comments to Joy and Cici. Make a plan for them both
to continue work and next steps.

### Speakerbox Planning
Review and resolve comments from Nic. Start gathering papers to read to back up
work.

## Actually Worked On

### CDP Scrapers Undergrads Management
Left comments for them both on GitHub. Also gave them next steps. Also sent out
when2meet for scheduling new meetings. Talked with Nic about Houston problems,
found out we can potentially get an incredibly large dataset relatively easily.
Would be messy but a lot of data. Also made a plan for the undergrads to contact
people in their respective communities about the instance deployment once scripts
are ready.

### Speakerbox Planning
Resolved all of Nic's comments. Moved most of the interjection classier to a new
document, only leaving the parts where the trained and ready classifier is used in
the speakerbox paper. Also started finding a lot of papers to read both for the
speakerbox paper and in general.

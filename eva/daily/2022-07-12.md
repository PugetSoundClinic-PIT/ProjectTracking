# Daily Tracking
_11 July 2022_

## Originally Planned

### CDP Scrapers Undergrads Management
Respond to whatever they send along / need help with.

### Speakerbox Planning
Spend a majority of the day reviewing and responding to comments from Nic.
Resolving and changing the hypotheses where needed. Then starting on literature
review.

## Actually Worked On

### CDP Scrapers Undergrads Management
Long meeting with the undergrads to share progress.
Additionally helped Joy make a PR from her fork of cdp-scrapers.
Explained some terminology and bugs and discussed potential problem areas.

### Speakerbox Planning
Didn't spend too much time on this unfortunately. Mostly did a quick pass of
over of comments from Nic then a cursory search of literature to get an idea as
to where to look.

## Comments

I didn't do much today in the form of "work". I came out to a lot of people today
and changed over a lot of account info, updated a bunch of stuff and just felt
emotionally exhausted by the time I was done responding to messages and stuff.
I am only going to log two (2) hours for today because of this.

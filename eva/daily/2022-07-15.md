# Daily Tracking
_15 July 2022_

## Originally Planned

### Swagit Scraper for Dataset Research
Finish up and start a longer run of the Swagit Scraper to get an idea of
the data available.

### Software Search
Work on https://github.com/PugetSoundClinic-PIT/soft-search/issues/1 and
https://github.com/PugetSoundClinic-PIT/soft-search/issues/2 -- creating
an early prototype dataset for understanding how many proposals promise
the delivery of software.

### PIT Book
Discuss and share ideas. Maybe work a bit on the chapter or review Richards work.

### Undergrads Management
Resolve any questions and comments from Joy. Cici has GRE tomorrow so she is studying.
Planning Python lecture for Tuesday.

## Actually Worked On

### Swagit Scraper for Dataset Research
Made the scraper able to sample indices and figured out good defaults
that won't hit the timeouts.

Longer run of ~4000 pages processed so far.

### Software Search
Largely done with both the first two issues of getting the prototype dataset.
Nic left some comments. I will resolve on Monday.

### PIT Book
Discussed and shared updates. Nic is going to find some readings for the group
to work through together. Richard and I shared our docs with each other.
I will go through Richards on Monday.

### Undergrads Management
Very minimal needed from me for Joy. She is working on the basic scraper now.

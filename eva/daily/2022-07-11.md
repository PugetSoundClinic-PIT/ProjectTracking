_11 July 2022_

## Originally Planned

### CDP Scrapers Undergrads Management
Respond to whatever they send along / need help with.

### PIT Book -- Administration Chapter
Major focus of the day. Read more papers, watch more lectures, add more notes.

## Actually Worked On

### CDP Scrapers Undergrads Management
Didn't need to do anything major.

### CDP General Management
New website merged and Shak comments resolved.

### PIT Book -- Administration Chapter
Watched the Don Moynihan lecture. Left a bunch of notes in the main administration
chapter document. Started filling out the Case Studies and Activities sections.
Major case studies I am thinking about are GetCalFresh, ClearViction, and CiviForm.
I am sure there are many more and we may find better ones but I think all three are
interesting for different reasons.

Activities are minimal but starting to take shape.
